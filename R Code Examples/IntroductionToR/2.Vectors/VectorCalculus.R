# Vector Calculus


# computations are performed element-wise

earnings <- c(50, 100, 30)
earnings * 3
earnings / 10
earnings -20
earnings + 100
earnings ^ 2



# Element-wise

earnings <- c(50, 100, 30)
expenses <- c(30, 40, 80)
earnings - expenses

earnings + c(10,20,30)
earnings * c(1, 2, 3)
earnings / c(1, 2, 3)

bank <- earnings - expenses
