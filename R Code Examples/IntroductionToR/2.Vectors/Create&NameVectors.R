# Create & Name Vectors



# create a vector 

drawn_suits <- c("hearts", "spades", "diamonds", "diamonds", "spades")
is.vector(drawn_suits)

remain <- c(11, 12, 11, 13)
remain



# name a vector

suits <- c("spades", "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs")
names(remain) <-suits
remain
# or
remain <- c("spades" = 11, "hearts" = 12, "diamonds" = 11, "clubs" = 13)
# or
remain <- c(spades = 11, hearts = 12, diamonds = 11, clubs = 13)

str(remain)



# single value = vector

my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- "six"

is.vector(my_apples)
is.vector(my_oranges)

length(my_apples)
length(my_oranges)
length(remain)



### vectors are homogeneous | atomic vectors
# A vector can only hold elements of the same type. They're
# also often called *atomic vectors*, to differentiate them from *lists*. 
# Another data structure which can hold elements of different types. 
# This means that you cannot have a vector that contains both logicals and numerics
# numerics, for example. If you do try to build such a vector, 
# R automatically performs coercion to make sure that you end up with 
# a vector that contains elements of the same type.


# coercion for vectors

drawn_ranks <- c(7, 4, "A", 10, "K", 3, 2, "Q")
drawn_ranks
class(drawn_ranks)




### DataCamp



# Create a vector (1)
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)



# Create a vector (2)
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)



# Naming a vector (1)
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
# Add names to both poker_vector and roulette_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")



# Naming a vector (2)
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
# Create the variable days_vector
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
# Assign the names of the day to 'roulette_vector' and 'poker_vector'
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector
